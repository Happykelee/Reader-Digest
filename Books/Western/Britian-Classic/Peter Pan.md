# Peter Pan
_by ****_

They took it for granted that if they went te would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Children are always ready to desert their loved ones when adventure calls.  
孩子们觉得他们都去，Peter也就一定会去，他们吧这想得理所当然，其实Peter到底去不去，他们其实并不怎么在乎。孩子们总是这样，当冒险在前方召唤时，他们宁愿抛下最亲的人。

No one knows as quickly as a child when he should give in.  
没有人比孩子更快知道什么时候该让步屈服。

The night's works was not yet over, for it was not the redkins Hook had come out to destroy; they were only the bees to be driven away, so that he should get at the honey.  
但是这一夜的事情并没有过去，因为Hook今夜并不是为了杀印第安人，印第安人不过是要被赶走的蜜蜂，而他要取的是蜜。

They smiles at each other and rubbed their hands.  
他们相视而笑，摩拳擦掌。

the pirate's ship, JOLLY ROGER.  
She was the cruelest ship on the seas, and scarcely nedded that careful eye, because of the horror of her reputation. She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore.

If the pirates had kept together, it was certain that they would have won; but the fight came when they were still unarmed, and they ran here and there, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last person alive out of the crew.  
要是海盗们在一起战斗的话，那他们肯定会赢的；可是，现实是在他们赤手空拳的时候战斗就开始了，他们四处逃散，乱打一气，每个人都认为自己有可能就是最后活下来的那个人。

Hook fought strongly now, and every swing of that terrible sword would have cut anything that was in its way, but Peter flew round him as if the very wind Hook's sword made blew him out of the danger zone.  
现在Hook在奋力战斗，他每一次挥剑都会砍掉任何挡他道的东西，但Peter只是在他周围飞着，好像Hook的每一阵剑风都会把他吹出危险区。

At the sight of his own blood, the sword fell down Hook's hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.  
Hook看到了自己的血，剑从他的手里落下，他现在任凭Peter摆布。

Years rolled on(时光飞逝) again, and Wendy had a daughter. She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look(一种好发问的古怪神情)， as if from the moment she arrived in the world she wanted to ask questions.
