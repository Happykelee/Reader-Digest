# the Call of Wild
_by John Griffith London_

He did not try to steal from the newcomers.  
He was a sad, dark fellow.  
"Dave" he was called, and he ate and slept, and took interest in nothing.  
Day and night the ship rocked to the endless sound of the engine.  
Although one day was very like another, it was clear to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder.  
At last, one morning, the engine was quiet, and the Narwhal was filled with an atmosphere of excitement.

A man with a club is to be obeye, but not necessarily bowed to.  
对手上拿着棍棒的人，需要顺从，但不是一定要臣服。

There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life.  
这是一种标志着生命巅峰(summit)的狂喜(ecstasy)。  
And the paradox of living is that this ecstasy that comes when one is most alive, comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive.  
生命的两重性在于此，一个人最亢奋时候表现出来的狂喜，让他忘了自己还活着。  
This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flaming color;  
这种对生存的忘却，出现在艺术家身上，是沉浸在烈火般的激情中忘却了生存  
it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a field of death but refusing to surrender;  
and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight.

He had been grapped tight by that mysterious pride of the trail-that pride which makes dogs work until their last gasp.  
这种难以名状的骄傲深深地吸引了他，这种骄傲左右着劳作的狗，只要一息尚存（last gasp），就会继续工作。

He lay down low to the race, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by leap, in the white moonlight.  
他压低身体奔跑，他修长的身体在白月光下跳跃着飞速前进。

He was mastered by the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew glowing and bursting with life, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the fact of dead matter that did not move.  
Buck陷入……的狂喜，在运动中表现自己，在星光下快乐的飞奔(flying exultantly)。

The winter silence had been driven away by the sounds of awakening life, coming form the things that lived and moved again.  
冬天的沉寂，被万物复苏的声音赶走了。

From below came a loud roaring, where the wild current went wilder, and sharp rocks split the river like a mouthful of sharp teeth.  
下方传来一声巨响，水流更加湍急，锋利的石头像一嘴锋利的牙齿，把河流分开。

But where there was no other life nor sign of life-only the blowing of cold winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.  
但这里没有生命，也没有生命的痕迹——只有呼啸的寒风，凝结的冰雪，和孤寂的海岸上的波浪。

There is a patience of the wild-tireless, persistent as life itself-that holds still for endless hours the spider in its web, the snake in its coils, the tiger waiting in ambush(埋伏地).  
This patience belongs especially to life when it hunts its living food, and it belonged to Buck as he kept beside the herd,  
slowing its progress, upsetting the young bulls, harassing(不断攻击) the cows(雌性动物) with their half-grown calves(幼崽), and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.
