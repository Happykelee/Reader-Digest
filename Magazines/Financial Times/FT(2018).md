The rise of the robots has raised the possibility of a future where there is simply less work for humans to do. To **frazzled** office workers, a world where we all have a bit more leisure time sounds rather nice. Yet what really matters is not just the total amount of human labour that will be needed in future. It is how that work will be distributed across the workforce.
机器人的发展提高了这样一种未来的可能性：留给人类做的工作会减少。对于疲惫的办公室员工而言，拥有多一点的闲暇时间听上去是个不错的主意。然而，真正重要的不只是未来需要的人类劳动力的总量，还有工作将如何在劳动力队伍中**分配**。

The rationale is that there is only about 40 minutes of glycogen stored in leg muscles, which is why runners have to keep gulping down sweets during marathons or they end up "hitting the wall" two-thirds of the way through the race. But even lean athletes have several pounds of stored fat reserves, so if those could be tapped, you could cycle for hours without running out of fuel. So some Tour de France cyclists have started using this approach.
