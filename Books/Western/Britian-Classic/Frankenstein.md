# Frankenstein

My life might have been passed in ease and comfort, but I preferred glory to every pleasure that wealth placed in my path.  
我本来也可以悠闲逍遥地过着轻松的生活，但我更喜欢将财富放置于通往荣耀的路上。

I began by making my body used to hardship. I went on whale hunting expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day. Then, at nights, I studied mathematics, the theory of medicine, and science of practical importance of a sea-going adventurer.

Thinking of it, I feel the same joy a child feels when he sails his little boat on a voyage of discovery up his native river.  
光想着此事，我都能感受到“一个小孩登上一艘小船，准备沿着自家门前的小河去历险”那样的喜悦心情。

Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her forehead was high and clear, and her blue eyes were cloudless. Her lips and the shape of her face showed so much sensibility and sweetness that she seemed to be a being sent from heaven.

The world was to me a secret which I desired to reveal. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, and gladness close to joy, are among the earliest feelings I can remember.  
世界一直对我来说是个想要解开的迷。巨大的好奇心，试图揭开自然界所隐藏着的法则的狂热，以及揭开谜团后的欣喜若狂，这种儿时最早的情感波澜，我至今都能记得。

I shall never forget his words:"The ancient teachers of the science," said he, "promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be changed into other metals, and that the elixir(长生不老药) of life is a fantasy. But these scientists, whose hands seem only made to dabble(涉足) in dirt, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the secrets of nature, and show how she works in her hiding-places."

Help to heal the wounds of our minds instead of letting them fester(溃烂).  
Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection ofr those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.  
"Your affectionate and suffering father……

And then by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window blinds, I saw the monster whom I had created.  
这时，昏黄的月光透过百叶窗照射进来，我看见了那个亲手造出来的怪物。

If you will agree with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace. If you refuse, I will feed the mouth of death with the blood of your remaining friends.

And chiefly toward you my arch-enemy, my creator, do I swear endless hatred.  
而且主要就是针对你——我的死敌，我的创造者——我发誓要与你不共戴天。

I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed at the beginning of his existence, and the subquent ruin of all kind feelings by the loathing which the cottagers had shown him.   
我想到，他出生之时，还表现出一些善良品格的可能，可后来由于农舍一家对他表现出来的厌恶将他善良的本性可能全部扼杀了。

This sentiment(意识,感想) of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have given in to despair. I have believed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.  
正是意识到自己这种天性的价值，所以我才能在其他人可能因为抑郁不堪而放弃的时候挺过来。我觉得，把本可以造福于我同胞的才能白白浪费在还无意义的哀叹上就等于犯罪。

All my hopes and dreams are as nothing, and like the archangel(撒旦) who tried to rise to godlike power, I am chained in an eternal hell.  
我所有的希望和抱负都化作泡影。我就像那个天使长相，一心渴望获得上帝般的力量，到头来却被永远禁锢在永恒的地狱之中。

I rose to heaven in my thought, now delighting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was filled with hopes and a high ambitions; but how low am I sunk.  
我那时想入非非狂妄自大，有时为自己的才干自鸣得意，有时又渴望知道这些才干会取得什么成就。从幼时起，我就充满希望，有远大的理想，但我现在却如此潦倒落魄。
